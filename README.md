# Heartbeat-Classification
Classification of heartbeat type from signals of single terminal electrocardiograph signals.

The present work aims to make the most as accurately as possible to classify heartbeats in four types using neural networks.
Two architectures are presented whose parameters are experimentally investigated and selected by means of based on the best accuracy. The data are used for both training and
evaluation of the model are taken from the competition PhysioNet/CinC competition that was held in 2017 and had aiming to create the most reliable and reliable classification algorithms. The results of the experiments showed that an extension of the given architecture after searching for the optimal hyper-parameters is the most ideal choice of those investigated with an accuracy rate of 77%.
